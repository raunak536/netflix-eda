# Netflix Data EDA using seaborn

## Problem Statement :
I have taken sample Netflix data to analyze and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries

## Insights :
- Content creation has exploded post 2015, reaching maximum in 2018 
- The fraction of TV shows created has been steadily increasing since 2017, surpassing 50% mark in 2021 
- Content added on netflix has grown exponentially since 2015, reaching maximum in 2019 
- Content has been added uniformly across all months 
- Netflix has a strong preference of adding content on either 1st or 15th of a month 
- Best Movie Director : Rajiv Chilaka (Animator for Chota Bheem) 
- Best Movie Cast : Anupam Kher (Big Bollywood Star) 
- Best TV Show Director : Alastair Fothergill (Nature Documentaries like Our Planet) 
- Best TV Show Cast : Takahiro Sakurai (Japanese Voice actor eg Jujutsu Kaisen) 
- Top 3 movie Genres : Dramas, Comedies, Documentaries 
- Top 3 TV Show Genres : Dramas, Comedies, Crime 
- US is top producer leading in 35 out of 42 Genres 

## Recommendations :
- Netflix should keep on adding content which has been produced in US as it has its strongest holding there
- In order to expand into more countries, Netflix needs to look beyond its biggest producers ie US. It needs to add content from countries which shows the highest promise for a particular genre, and also needs to hire the best native talent in terms of the director and the cast. Following are some my recommendations based on data :
  - Thrillers : Directed by Anurag Kashyap casting Nawazuddin Siddiqui produced in India
  - Docuseries : Directed by Alastair Fothergill casting David Attenborough produced in UK
  - TV Dramas : Directed by Jeon Go-woon casting Cho Seong-ha produced in South Korea
  - Sports Movies : Directed by Clay Porter casting Usain Bolt produced in UK
